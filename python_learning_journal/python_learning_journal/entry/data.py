        'Today I learned about Cython, ipython, virtual environments, exceptions, and traceback stacks. I\'m happy to start this journey! I want to start on the right foot: I plan on completing all the readings and augment what I learn in class with online resources (Treehouse, HackerRank, Codecademy)'},

        'Pytest is super cool. As a person who likes to plan things out before making any decisions, TDD is my new favorite approach to programming. The ping-pong programming went really good. I had too much coffee today. And I should start keeping my sandwiches in the fridge from now on. Oh and the weather sucked today.'},

        'Today was fun. It was a lot, but I feel like Alex and I are making great progress on our assignments. The trigram code works. We just need to handle some edge cases I think and write more robust tests. I finished half of the pseudo code assignment. This one sounds like fun! I\'m having a blast but I pretty concerned about work. I need to work part-time to stay afloat and seeing how much time this class is taking, I\'m gonna really struggle with time. I\'m having a blast, but I just wish all I had on my plate was this class. I could dive deeper into these assignments and other material...life'},

        'Today I learned about using Tox to make sure my Python code works in both versions 2 and 3. Super cool. List comprehensions are cool. This was the first thing about Python that blew my mind, coming from Java and C++. Those languages don\'t have that kind of concise power as Python. Rightly so for C++, as it\'s a mid-level language. But I\'m loving Python more and more. It\'s as if the developers have thought of everything. It has so many tools and cool packages. Super happy to be a part of the Python community.'},

        'Working with sockets today was fun. I\'m glad we\'re learning some networking programming. It\'s so much easier than in C++. Data structures were fun to work on as well. I had to push my lightning talk back as I have too much work to do tonight. I\'ll be nervous a few more days.'},

We\'re are going to take a look at it with fresh eyes tomorrow. I\'m also preparing for my lightning talk. What is sleep?'},

        'Today, David and I knocked out more of our server assignments. We\'re making good steady progress. I just have so much stuff to resubmit so I feel pretty swamped. Castro and I knocked out our queue implementation very fast. I\'m glad the lightning talk is over.'},
